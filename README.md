# GUI Scale About
This is a COSMIC applet for Tailscale. Currently, it's very basic, but I am working on adding features such as TailDrop to send files across your tailnet.

## Dependencies
You must first run:

```bash
sudo tailscale set --operator=$USER
```

This makes it where the applet doesn't need sudo to do it's job.
